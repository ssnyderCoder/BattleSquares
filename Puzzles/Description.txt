v.0.2
---------------------------------------------
-Game now has main battlesquares set up as well as one minigame
FEELINGS:
+Game now starting to become somewhat fun
-A bit difficult to constantly move eyes between the minigame and the main game
+Hard player is a pretty decent challenge for me; probably just the right setting
+leaderboard has nice fluid mobile feeling
-Green arrows blend in too much with green player (especially facing upward)

AI TESTING NOTES:
>low capture rate = slow expansion(50%), but many high(300+) value squares --- opponents can end up wasting much time versus this ai
>medium capture rate = medium expansion, with some semi-high(150+) value squares
>high capture rate = fast expansion(200%), but with very few decent(100+) value squares
>action rate supplements difficulty; higher action rate means more actions taken
>Difficulty affects number of actions per second & chance of conquering higher value squares
