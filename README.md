BattleSquares - Made by Sean Snyder
=============

A puzzle rts game made in Actionscript involving capturing territory by winning minigames.

------------

This small game is meant as an exercise to improve my programming skills and provide me with more experience with flashpunk.  
In this game, your goal is to capture as much territory as you can before time runs out, all while competing against up to 3 computer players.  Capturing territory involves playing minigames that will vary based on the type of territory being attacked.  Every player can attack unclaimed territory or enemy territory.  The higher the score you get in the minigames, the tougher it will be for enemy players to capture your territory.  Some territories can grant bonuses, but they take longer to capture.  When the time runs out, the player with the most territory wins.

As of the current version, territory is represented by a grid of colored squares. Additionally, the only minigame currently programmed is a bubble breaker clone. Gameplay has more of an arena-like setup rather than levels. I plan to add a few additional simple minigames, as well as tutorial levels and regular levels.  The game has somewhat abstract graphics right now, but I may consider adding an actual graphical theme at some point.
